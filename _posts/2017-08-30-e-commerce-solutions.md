# E-commerce solutions..

There are many sites out there that will allow - for a fee - to set up a store front and sell your produce, but what if you want it to be part of your grid site ?

One of the best solutions we have come across is from [Ecwid][0]. A fully functioning e-commerce solution from end to end.. and best of all, you can try it for free!

Yup, if you only have 10 items to sell, they won't charge you for setting up a store. The next level up to get 100 products, and a whole lot more of features, is only $12.50/mth if paid yearly. A complete list of the features for the various tiers can be found [here][1].

Their backend is easy to use, and Customer Service is great through the chat window.

To add the store to your site, you are going to want to have the embedded html window on the Homepage, so that we can take advantage of the 800px width.

The embed code, we don't even have to make any changes, only the height of the embedded html window, which for our store below is set to 1350\.

The code itself after you have created your store would look similar to :

    <div id="my-store-11614093"></div>
    <div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://app.ecwid.com/script.js?11614093&data_platform=code&data_date=2017-05-31" charset="utf-8"></script><script type="text/javascript"> xProductBrowser("categoriesPerRow=3","views=grid(20,3) list(60) table(60)","categoryView=grid","searchView=list","id=my-store-11614093");</script>
    </div>

Very easy to setup, and now your gris site has a store. In the example below, you can buy anything and even checkout.. the only part disabled is the actual payment methods.. thanks.
